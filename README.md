# Employee File Management with AI Automation

A full-stack project designed to automate employee file management, resume analysis, and employee search using AI (LLM) integration, RESTful APIs, and a modern web frontend. This project leverages document parsing, AI-powered insights, and skill-based search to streamline HR and employee management workflows.

## üöÄ Features

- **Employee Management**: CRUD operations for employee data via RESTful APIs.
- **File/Resume Upload & Extraction**: Upload employee files (resumes, docs) and extract content using Apache Tika.
- **AI Resume Analysis**: Query AI (Ollama LLM) to extract skills, experience, and answer custom questions about employees.
- **Skill-Based Search**: Search employees by skill using a simple frontend interface.
- **Web UI**: User-friendly frontend for querying employees, asking AI questions, and searching by skill.
- **Role/Position Query**: Instantly retrieve an employee‚Äôs role via API or UI.
- **Backend REST API**: Exposes endpoints for all core functions (employee data, file analysis, skill search, etc).
- **Modular Backend**: Java (Spring Boot) backend for scalability and extensibility.

## üõ†Ô∏è Main Functionalities

### 1. **Employee CRUD APIs**
- Create, read, update, delete employees.
- Fetch employee by ID or name.
- API: `/api/employees`, `/api/employees/{id}`, `/api/employees/search-by-skill?skill=...`

### 2. **File/Resume Upload & Extraction**
- Upload employee files (resume, docs) to server.
- Extract text from files using Apache Tika.
- API: `/api/files/upload`, `/api/files/analyze/employee/{id}`

### 3. **AI-Powered Resume/Document Analysis**
- Analyze resume text with Ollama LLM (models: phi3, llama3).
- Custom user queries (skills, experience, qualification extraction, etc).
- AI integration via `/api/generate` (Python: `AI_Model.py`).

### 4. **Skill-Based Employee Search**
- Query all employees with a given skill.
- API: `/api/employees/search-by-skill?skill=Python`

### 5. **Role/Position Query**
- Special-cased fast retrieval of employee role/position.
- "What is the role/position?" auto-detected in both frontend and backend.

### 6. **Frontend Features**
- Query by employee ID or name.
- Free-form AI question ("What are his skills?", "Summarize work experience", etc).
- Skill-based employee search.
- Results shown in a user-friendly format.

## üß† AI Model Integration (`AI_Model.py`)

- Uses Apache Tika to extract text from uploaded files.
- Sends user queries + extracted text to Ollama LLM via a local API.
- Handles streaming AI responses for efficiency.
- Example queries:
  - "Extract all skills, qualifications, and work experience from this resume:"
  - "What technologies does this employee know?"
  - "Summarize key projects."
  - Special handling for "role" or "position" queries (returns directly from employee data).

---

## üåê Frontend UI (`FrontEndJS.html`)

- Simple HTML/JS frontend for:
  - Querying employees by ID or name.
  - Asking AI-powered questions about employees.
  - Searching employees by skill.
- Calls backend APIs and displays formatted results.
- Handles error states and shows loading indicators.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, JPA (Hibernate), RESTful APIs
- **Frontend**: HTML, JavaScript
- **AI/Parsing**: Python, Apache Tika, Ollama LLM (local API)
- **Database**: (Typically H2, MySQL, or PostgreSQL in Spring Boot projects)

---

## üèÅ Quick Start

1. **Start Backend**
   - `cd efm-backend`
   - `./mvnw spring-boot:run` (or use your IDE)

2. **Start Python AI Service**
   - Install dependencies: `pip install tika requests`
   - Run Ollama server locally with desired model (phi3, llama3)
   - Run `python AI_Model.py`

3. **Open Frontend**
   - Open `FrontEndJS.html` in your browser.

4. **Try It Out**
   - Upload resumes via backend or place in the `ENGINEERING` folder (as referenced in Python).
   - Enter employee ID or name, ask AI questions, or search by skill.

## üìä Example Usage Scenarios

- **HR wants to know ‚ÄúWhat are the main skills of employee 2?‚Äù**
- **Manager wants to find ‚ÄúAll employees with Python skill‚Äù**
- **Auto-extract all work experience and projects from uploaded resumes**
- **Quickly check the role/position of an employee**

---

## üìÑ Sample AI Query Results

- **Query:** _What projects has this employee worked on?_
- **AI Response:**  
  - "Worked on Inventory Management System using Java and Spring Boot."
  - "Developed RESTful APIs for HR automation."
